# Quick Setup Guide - Fix Lead Addition Error

## The Problem
You're getting "Failed to add lead to Google Sheets" error because the current webhook doesn't exist.

## Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Google Apps Script
1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Delete the default code
4. Copy and paste the code from `simple-google-apps-script.js`
5. Save the project (Ctrl+S)

### Step 2: Deploy as Web App
1. Click "Deploy" â†’ "New deployment"
2. Choose "Web app" as the type
3. Set "Execute as" to "Me"
4. Set "Who has access" to "Anyone"
5. Click "Deploy"
6. **Copy the web app URL** (it looks like: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/.../exec`)

### Step 3: Update Your API
1. Open `src/app/api/leads/route.ts`
2. Find line 117: `const googleAppsScriptUrl = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL_HERE';`
3. Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL_HERE` with your copied URL
4. Save the file

### Step 4: Test
1. Restart your Next.js server
2. Go to a project's leads page
3. Click "Add Lead" and fill out the form
4. Submit - it should work now!

## Alternative: Manual Addition (Temporary)
If you want to test the frontend immediately without setting up the script:

1. The current code logs all lead data to the console
2. Open browser dev tools (F12)
3. Try adding a lead
4. Check the console for the logged data
5. Manually copy the data to your Google Sheet

## What This Does
- Adds leads directly to your existing "Leads" tab
- Maintains the correct column structure
- Uses the project ID from the current project
- Generates proper timestamps and IDs

## Troubleshooting
- Make sure the web app URL is correct
- Check that the sheet name is "Leads" (case-sensitive)
- Verify you have edit access to the Google Sheet
- Check browser console for any error messages
